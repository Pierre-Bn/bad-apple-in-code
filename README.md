# bad-apple-in-code
A piece of code that generated the famous Bad Apple!! remix music video within itself.

In order to recreate it yourself, pretty much all you'll need is ffmpeg and opencv. 
You'll also need to update the consts at the start of the script, to make sure things like window coordinates fit with your device, but that's about it. Just mind the fact that the frames folders will end up being a few GBs large (with the default screenshot dimensions, it's 3.59GB).

Sorry if some of the code looks nasty lmao, i needed some extra characters to be able to fill the 100% black frames of the video. I could have written shorter code, but I would have had to add some filler comments at the end, and that wouldn't be a e s t h e t i c.
